## Intro to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is Amazon's cloud object storage service.

Amazon `S3` objects consist of the following:
- `Key`: Name assigned to the object
- `Version ID`: string generated by Amazon when you add an object to a bucket
- `Value`: content stored within
- `Metadata`: set of name-value pairs that allow you to store information regarding the object
- `Subresources`: machanism to store object-specific information
- `Access control information`: allows you to contorl access to objects stored

One of the great benefits of the S3 service is that you are able to create virtual storage extremely fast.

The service offers scalability, data availability, security, and high performance.

### Common Use Cases:

- Host Static Websites
- Store and secure small or large amounts of data

    - at a very low rate (glacial -- a different type of S3 bucket)
