## AWS Basics

Welcome! This course will be exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS). The course will cover many key elements of `AWS`, some of the problems you can solve using this tool, and most importantly you will be getting hands on practice with this very commonly used tool.

### Brief History

Amazon first began offering Information Technology services in 2006. The goal was to create a platform that allowed businesses and individuals alike to replace any infrastructure or on-premise servers with virtaul servers provided by AWS.

Amazon created this platform as a low-cost alternative within the cloud that is highly scalable, reliable, and performance optimized.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon S3 are among the first services provided by AWS. These first-generation services are still used to this day but have of course changed over time.
