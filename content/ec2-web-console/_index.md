## Intro to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Amazon `EC2` is one of Amazon's many Web Services. One of the great benefits of the `EC2` service is that you are able to create a virtual server within the cloud extremely fast. 

The `EC2` service is commonly referred to as secure, scalable, and reliable.

Dependant upon the requirements for your application, any `Virtual Server` you create within the `EC2` service is customizable with various `Instance Types`, `Network Settings`, and `Storage`. 

Some of these settings are slightly out of scope for what we are trying to accomplish with this course. We will be utilizing the `free` tier eligible options so that you do not accrue larger amounts of cost when using `AWS`.

This course will utilize the `EC2` service for the following:
- Deploying Static Websites to Virtual `Linux` Server's
- Deploying Persistent Web Applications to a Virtual `Linux` Server connected to a private `RDS Database`
