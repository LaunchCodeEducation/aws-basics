One thing to always keep track of is your active resources. One way to see what resources are being used is to view the billing dashboard.

In order to view the billing for your `AWS Account` you can simply search for it.

Type in the word `billing` into your search feature and select the Billing option.

This will bring you to your billing dashboard where you are able to view your `AWS Summary`.

You can view more details for your resources in the `Bills` section of your `Billing Dashboard`.

### Shutting Down Resources

When you are finished using a resource for learning and exercise purposes, it is probably best to stop any active resources when you are finished for the day. This will keep any resources from accumulating any unecessary charges.
