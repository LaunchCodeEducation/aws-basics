# AWS Basics

## Working on this Site

AWS Basics uses Hugo, a static site generator built on Go. Before you can work on it, you need to have Hugo installed on your machine. To do so, follow the [steps](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) in the documentation.

As you start contributing, you may notice that certain components are made up of submodules. These submodules are the building blocks of Hugo and can be used to add important features, such as the theme. The submodules are built in Go and added via Git. If you are not familiar with Git submodules, check out the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). If the submodules are not loading, you may have to manually update them to get them to load.
